Originally, the DetermineTrialSuccess program 
did not account for the fact that, due to the 
boxcar implementation and the refractory period, 
there might be long gaps in the pattern recall of the network.
This was the case in the unidirectional rule, where, for example,
pattern x would be recognised at timestep t, then 
no external input neurons would fire at all for 2 timesteps, 
then pattern x+1 would be recognised at timestep t+3. In other words,
the unidirectional rule under the boxcar tends to skip more, 
with less density in the number of neurons firing per pattern.

What is weird is that, despite this problem happening with boxcar 4 uni, 
it did not become an issue with the bidirectional case.

This might be because I lowered the activity for the unidirectional 
rule from 0.1 / 4 boxcars to 0.08 / 4 boxcars.


FIRST FAILURE MODE DETECTOR IMPLEMENTATION:
rng(1)
noisy till trial 25

trial 64: 
%   external activity died but context nrn attractor developed
trial 81,86,87,91-97, 105, 107, 111-112, 126, 129, 131, 134, 138, 141, 143, 144, 148, 150: 
%   attractor developed at externals but not recognised due to skips




NEURON NUMBERS
It seems the learning peak for bidirectional is pretty much the same as the number of neurons is increased
if we consider the graphs plotting trials with at least one success against
number of patterns, the plots have the following modes:
1000 nrns: 34
2000 nrns: 32
