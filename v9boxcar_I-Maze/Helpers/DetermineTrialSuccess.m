    %previously used was the path method (which is now discontinued), where
    %we define a valid path on the ordered set of patterns as being
    %x |-> x or x |-> x+1 where x is the current pattern number.
    %Take the cosine matrix, convert to logical and check if there
    %exists a path from the first to the last pattern where the steps allowed
    %are dwell and jump 1 pattern

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    %Ordered First Firing Method of Determining Successful Trials
    %to determine the success of a network, instead of thinking in terms of
    %neurons firing, we think in terms of 'patterns firing', where if even 1
    %neuron corresponding to pattern x fires, we consider it the same as every
    %neuron in pattern x firing. The matrix describing the firing of patterns
    %over time is referred to as the filter matrix.
    %The output of a trial is considered a successful one if the following 
    %conditions are all met:
    %1) every pattern must fire
    %2) There exist a sequence of nonzero entries (x_i,t_i)_{i \in 1:n_pat} 
    %   in the filter matrix, where
    %   for all i<j, x_i < x_j and t_i < t_j
    %3) the output must not be 'too noisy', where
    %
    %we use the following criterion to classify noisy inputs:
    %       the first and last patterns fire too close together in time
    %   OR  the last pattern fires before the middle pattern has ever fired
    %
    %
    %Finally, the function
    %classifies failure modes or successes and assigns a numeric code used to
    %classify the outcome of the network's output. These numeric codes can be
    %found in ./Helpers/FailureModeDictionary.m and the process of identifying
    %these failure modes is described in the comments written on the second 
    %chain of if else statements in this file.



    %Obtain test output of the network at given trial, number of patterns,
    %length of each trial and prototype input, 
    %which is an unnoised version of the input fed to the network

    %boxcar adjustments: The function needs to recognise recent firings, but as
    %the boxcar gets larger, the timescale becomes finer, which makes looking
    %at individual timesteps unreliable- for example, at boxcar 4, we need to
    %recognise an action potential and the 3 timesteps that follow 
    %that action potential as being equivalent to a an action potential and
    %the single timestep that follows it in boxcar 2, or simply with one
    %action potential in boxcar 1.

    %strength of a specific pattern being recognised as a function of the
    %weakest pattern strength throughout the trial.

    %or (i-1), then set entry i to timescale+1. This way, the only way that
    %condition (2) stated in the beginning of the file can be met is if the
    %last entry of the state_vect is nonzero, since the only way it can be so
    %is if pattern(n_pat) fires after the preceding pattern has already fired,
    %and so on recursively.

    %If it doesn't fire afterwards, subtract until it reaches 1. (in other
